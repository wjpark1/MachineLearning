# MachineLearning
This is a project that I built while taking COMPSCI 189: Introduction to Machine Learning, at Berkeley. Its files include a standalone perceptron implementation, a mini-library for constructing and training neural networks, and neural network models for a variety of applications. The result is a neural network that can solve various tasks.

## Technology
This project was built from scratch with Python, NumPy and Matplotlib. It does not use frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, etc. 

## Features
- Sin(x) approximation

## Installation
If you'd like to try it out from your end, please do the following:
1) Clone the repo into a local directory 
2) Download Python (as a framework), NumPy, and Matplotlib
3) Run 'pythonw autograder.py' in Terminal from the project directory

## Thank You!
Hopefully, everything goes well. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at wjpark@berkeley.edu!
