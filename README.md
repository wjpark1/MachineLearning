# MachineLearning
This is a project that I built while taking COMPSCI 189: Introduction to Machine Learning, at Berkeley.
It is a neural network implementation and library that uses matrix operations underneath.

## Technology
This project was built with Python, NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Sin(x) approximation

## Installation
If you'd like to try it out from your end, please do the following:
1) Clone the repo into a local directory 
2) Download Python (as a framework), NumPy, and Matplotlib
3) Run 'pythonw autograder.py' in Terminal from the project directory

## Thank You!
Hopefully, everything goes well. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at wjpark@berkeley.edu!
