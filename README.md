# MachineLearning
A neural network implementation built with Python, NumPy and Matplotlib. Here are some of the things it can do:

- Sin(x) approximation

- Digit classification (from MNIST dataset)

- Cartpole task

- Language identification

If you'd like to try it out from your end, please fork it, download Python (as a framework), NumPy, and Matplotlib, and then run 'pythonw autograder.py' in Terminal from the project directory.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to email me at wjpark@berkeley.edu. Thanks!
