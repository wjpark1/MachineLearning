# MachineLearning
This is a project that I built while taking a machine learning class at Berkeley (COMPSCI 189: Introduction to Machine Learning). Its files include a standalone perceptron implementation (perceptron.py), a mini-library for constructing and training neural networks (nn.py), and neural network models for a variety of applications (models.py). The net result is a neural network that can solve various tasks (see 'Features').

From a high level perspective, the project involved writing a perceptron algorithm and building a framework for building and training computation graphs. This framework was then applied to various applications like regression (Sin(x) Approximation), sequence tasks and deep Q-learning (Cartpole Task). 

## Technology
This project was built with Python, NumPy and Matplotlib. It does not use ML frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras. 

## Features
- Sin(x) Approximation

## Installation
If you'd like to try it out, please do the following:
1) Clone the repo into a local directory 
2) Download [Python 2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/), [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/install.html), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
3) Run 'python autograder.py' in Terminal from the project directory

## Thank You!
Hopefully, everything goes well. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me at wjpark@berkeley.edu!
